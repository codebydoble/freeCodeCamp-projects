    <h1>Naaldwijk Cod with Seasonal Vegetables and Dill Sauce</h1>
    <p>This is a classic Dutch recipe, reinterpreted with a modern, lighter touch. It focuses on the quality of
        <strong>fresh cod</strong>, a white fish highly prized for its tender, delicate flesh. The "Naaldwijk" (from
        Naaldwijk)
        designation
        emphasizes local sourcing and freshness, as the Westland region, where Naaldwijk is located, is famous for its
        greenhouses and agricultural products, as well as its proximity to the sea.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>For the Cod and Vegetables:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 fresh cod fillets (approx. 180-200g each), skinless and boneless</li>
        <li>1 bunch green asparagus or 200g fresh peas (depending on the season)</li>
        <li>100g fine green beans</li>
        <li>1 small onion or 2 shallots, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Fine sea salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For the Dill Sauce:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>100 ml cooking cream (or light crème fraîche)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh dill, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Juice of 1/2 lemon (approximately 20 ml)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (optional, for an extra kick)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the Vegetables:</p> Wash and trim the ends of the asparagus and green beans. If using asparagus,
            cut them into pieces about 3-4 cm
            long. If using peas, shell them. Finely chop the onion or shallot and thinly slice the garlic cloves.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cook the Vegetables:</p>
            In a large pan over medium heat, warm one tablespoon of olive oil. Add the chopped onion/shallot and cook
            until
            translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the sliced garlic and cook for one more minute, making sure it doesn't
            brown
            too much. Stir in the asparagus (or peas) and green beans. Add a splash of water (approximately 50 ml),
            cover
            the pan, and gently steam for 5-7 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender yet still crisp. Season with
            salt
            and pepper. Remove the vegetables from the pan and set aside, keeping them warm.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the Cod:</p>
            While the vegetables are cooking, pat the cod fillets dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously
            with
            sea salt and freshly ground black pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Cook the Cod:</p>
            In the same pan (if needed, add the other tablespoon of olive oil), heat the oil over medium-high heat. Once
            hot, place the cod fillets skin-side down (if they have skin) or the most presentable side down. Cook for
            3-4
            minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the fillet. The fish is done when the flesh appears opaque
            and
            flakes easily with a fork. Avoid overcooking to prevent it from drying out.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Prepare the Dill Sauce:</p>
            While the cod is cooking, in a small saucepan over low heat, pour in the cooking cream. Gently warm it
            without
            allowing it to boil vigorously. Remove from heat and stir in the finely chopped dill, lemon juice, and Dijon
            mustard (if using). Mix well and season with salt and pepper to taste. The sauce should have a fresh and
            slightly tangy flavor.
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Plate and Serve:</p>
            Place a generous portion of the cooked vegetables on each plate. Carefully arrange a cod fillet on top of
            the
            vegetables. Finally, drizzle a generous amount of the dill sauce over the fish and vegetables. Serve
            immediately.
