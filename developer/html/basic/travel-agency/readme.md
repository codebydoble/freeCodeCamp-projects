Plan Your Trip: Essential Cuba Travel Tips
Get ready for your Cuban adventure with our practical advice.

Visa Requirements: Most nationalities require a tourist card (visa) for Cuba. Check specific regulations for your country well in advance of your trip.

Currency: Cuba uses two main currencies for visitors: the Cuban Convertible Peso (CUC - often still mentioned, though largely phased out in favor of MLC) and the Moneda Libremente Convertible (MLC), which is pegged to the USD. Cash (Euros or Canadian Dollars are often preferred) is king, especially outside major tourist areas.

Internet & Connectivity: Internet access can be limited. Wi-Fi is usually available in hotels and public hotspots via ETECSA scratch cards. Be prepared for a more disconnected experience.

Safety & Health: Cuba is generally safe for tourists, but basic precautions apply. Stay hydrated, use sunscreen, and be aware of your surroundings. Consult your doctor for recommended vaccinations.

Best Time to Visit: The dry season (November to April) offers pleasant weather with less humidity. The wet season (May to October) can bring higher temperatures and humidity, with a risk of hurricanes from June to November.

Getting Around: Classic American cars (almendrones) are common for taxis. Viazul buses offer reliable inter-city travel. For organized tours, comfortable coaches are provided.
