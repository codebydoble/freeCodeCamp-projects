# Build a Bank Account Management Program

## Objective

Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

## User Stories

1. [x] You should define a class named BankAccount with a constructor. The constructor should set the default balance to 0 and initialize an empty array named transactions to store transaction records as objects.
2. [x] Each transaction stored in the transactions array should be an object with two properties: type and amount. The type property should be either deposit or withdraw, and the amount property should be the amount deposited or withdrawn.
3. [x] You should define a method named deposit that takes the deposit amount as a parameter. When the deposit amount is greater than 0, it should:

   - Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of deposit and the amount deposited.
   - Update the balance.
   - Return "Successfully deposited $[amount]. New balance: $[balance]".

4. [x] If the amount is less than or equal to 0, the deposit method should return "Deposit amount must be greater than zero.".

5. [x] You should define a method named withdraw that takes an amount as a parameter. This method should update the current balance according to withdrawals. When the amount to be withdrawn is greater than 0 and less than or equal to the current balance, it should:

   - Push a new object to the transactions array with a type of withdraw and the amount withdrawn.
   - Update the balance.
   - Return "Successfully withdrew $[amount]. New balance: $[balance]".

6. [x] If the amount to be withdrawn is less than or equal to 0 or greater than the current balance, the withdraw method should return "Insufficient balance or invalid amount.".

7. [x] You should define a method named checkBalance that returns the current balance in the format "Current balance: $[balance]".

8. [x] You should define a method named listAllDeposits that iterates through the transactions array and returns all deposits in the format "Deposits: amount,amount,...".

9. [x] You should define a method named listAllWithdrawals that iterates through the transactions array and returns all withdrawals in the format "Withdrawals: amount,amount,...".

10. [x] You should create a new instance of BankAccount named myAccount.

11. [x] Your myAccount bank account should have at least five transactions.

12. [x] Your myAccount bank account should have at least two deposits.
